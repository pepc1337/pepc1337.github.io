		<div>
		Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now<br>
		Watching, watching, as the credits all roll down<br>
		Crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house<br>
		<br>
		No heroes, villains, one to blame<br>
		While wilted roses filled the stage<br>
		And the thrill, the thrill is gone<br>
		Our debut was a masterpiece<br>
		But in the end for you and me<br>
		Oh, the show, it can't go on<br>
		<br>
		We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call<br>
		So hold for the applause, oh<br>
		And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow<br>
		Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		<br>
		Darling, darling, you know that we are sold out<br>
		This is fading, but the band plays on now<br>
		We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down<br>
		<br>
		No heroes, villains, one to blame<br>
		While wilted roses fill the stage<br>
		And the thrill, the thrill is gone<br>
		Our debut was a masterpiece<br>
		Our lines we read so perfectly<br>
		But the show, it can't go on<br>
		<br>
		We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call<br>
		So hold for the applause, oh<br>
		And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow<br>
		Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show<br>
		Stole the show<br>
		Least we stole the show

		<br>

		<div>
		Thought I could leave you cause I felt my heart numbing<br>
		It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running<br>
		I turned around and saw the look on your face<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		<br>
		But I don't need you and you should know that, baby<br>
		It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me<br>
		And I feel sorry for the look on your face<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		<br>
		You wanna leave her, don't wanna hurt nobody<br>
		I don't believe a single word you say or that you're sorry<br>
		Why can't I say no to the look on your face?<br>
		I just stay, stay<br>
		<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		<br>
		You push me away, push me away<br>
		But I always stay, I always stay, yeah<br>
		You push me away, push me away<br>
		But I always stay, I always stay<br>
		You push me away, push me away<br>
		But I always stay, I always stay, yeah<br>
		You push me away, push me away<br>
		But I always stay, I always stay, yeah<br>
		But will you? But will you? But will you?<br>
		<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		So I stayed, stayed<br>
		<br>
		I stay, I stay<br>
		Oh why, do I stay?<br>
		So I stayed, stayed

		I'm a flame<br>
		You're a fire<br>
		I'm the dark in need of light<br>
		When we touch, you inspire<br>
		Feel the change in me tonight<br>
		So take me up, take me higher<br>
		There's a world not far from here<br>
		We can dance in desire<br>
		Or we can burn in love tonight<br>
		<br>
		Our hearts are like firestones<br>
		And when they strike, we feel the love<br>
		Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones<br>
		But when they strike, we light up the world<br>
		<br>
		Our hearts are like firestones<br>
		And when they strike, we feel the love<br>
		Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones<br>
		But when they strike, we light up the world<br>
		We light up the world<br>
		<br>
		We light up the world<br>
		Oooh oooh<br>
		World<br>
		Oooh oooh<br>
		Firestone<br>
		<br>
		I'm from X, you're from Y<br>
		Perfect strangers in the night<br>
		Here we are, come together<br>
		To the world we'll testify<br>
		<br>
		Our hearts are like firestones<br>
		And when they strike, we feel the love<br>
		Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones<br>
		But when they strike, we light up the world<br>
		<br>
		Our hearts are like firestones<br>
		And when they strike, we feel the love<br>
		Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones<br>
		And when they strike, we light up the world<br>
		<br>
		We light up the world<br>
		We light up the world<br>
		Oooh oooh<br>
		World<br>

		<br>

		<div>
		Crazy to think that a man can't hurt<br>
		Love takes its toll every time it don't work, yeah<br>
		One door closes and another opens<br>
		But it's hard to let go when your heart's broken<br>
		I give you my trust, can you give me your word?<br>
		<br>
		Come take my heart of glass<br>
		And give me your love<br>
		I hope you'll still be there<br>
		To pick the pieces up<br>
		Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile<br>
		Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile<br>
		<br>
		After he left you and ten times ten<br>
		Could I put you back together again? Yeah<br>
		When a door closes and another opens<br>
		But I won't let go cause I'm not like him<br>
		Baby just say the words, let the love begin<br>
		<br>
		Come take my heart of glass<br>
		And give me your love<br>
		I hope you'll still be there<br>
		To pick the pieces up<br>
		Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile<br>
		Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile<br>
		<br>
		Yeah, you will take yours and mine<br>
		I got your heart of glass<br>
		And you've got my love<br>
		I know we'll still be there<br>
		To pick the pieces up<br>
		Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile<br>
		Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile

		<div>
		Standing in the cold in the frozen wind<br>
		I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end<br>
		No, no, no<br>
		Walking on a plane as I hold my breath<br>
		It's gonna be weeks 'til I breathe again<br>
		No, no, no<br>
		<br>
		I know that you hate it<br>
		And I hate it<br>
		Just as much as you<br>
		But if you can brave it<br>
		I can brave it<br>
		Brave it all for you<br>
		<br>
		Call me anytime that you see the lightning<br>
		Don't you feel alone, you can always find me<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		Lost among a million changing faces<br>
		Every day our hearts keep trading places<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		<br>
		Checking into hotel loneliness<br>
		It's not what I've been used to, I confess<br>
		To wake up three times a night<br>
		Talking to a stranger's nothing new<br>
		She knows how to smile but not like you<br>
		So I wait for you all night<br>
		<br>
		I know that you hate it<br>
		And I hate it<br>
		Just as much as you<br>
		But if you can brave it<br>
		I can brave it<br>
		Brave it all for you<br>
		<br>
		Call me anytime that you see the lightning<br>
		Don't you feel alone, you can always find me<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		Lost among a million changing faces<br>
		Every day our hearts keep trading places<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		<br>
		Call me anytime that you see the lightning<br>
		Don't you feel alone, you can always find me<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		Rolling on the wind with you forever<br>
		Holding onto us for worse or better<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		Raging, raging<br>
		Call me anytime that you see the lightning<br>
		Don't you feel alone, you can always find me<br>
		We've got a wild love raging, raging

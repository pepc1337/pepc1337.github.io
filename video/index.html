<h2>Lyrics</h2>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Thought I could leave you cause I felt my heart numbing</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>I turned around and saw the look on your face</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>So I stayed, stayed</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>But I don't need you and you should know that, baby</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>And I feel sorry for the look on your face</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>So I stayed, stayed</td>
		</tr>
